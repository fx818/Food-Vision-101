# Food-Vision-101
* This uses various Deep Learning aspects and creates a model to predict 101 different classes of food.
* The dataset was taken from `Official Food Vision 101 Research paper`
* The official research paper has an accuracy of ~50% and our model has an accuracy of ~45%

## Our Model
* I have made various models including curating my own model from scratch but that might not be sufficient as I have limited computation power
* So I have used ResNet models and finetuned them on our dataset
